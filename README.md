# EDGE-DETECTER

The Edge Detector project implements both rising and falling edge detectors using Verilog HDL. The Rising Edge Detector identifies transitions from low to high (0 to 1), while the Falling Edge Detector detects transitions from high to low (1 to 0) on an input signal. Each module uses a clock signal and a delayed version of the input signal to determine edges accurately. The design is simple yet efficient, making it suitable for digital systems that require precise edge detection for triggering events or synchronization. A comprehensive testbench is provided to simulate and verify the functionality of both edge detectors. The testbench generates clock and input signals, monitors the outputs, and logs the results for analysis. This project can be simulated using tools like ModelSim or Vivado.
